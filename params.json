{"name":"Vim-phoenix","tagline":"Vim plugin for working with the Phoenix framework","body":"# vim-phoenix\r\n\r\nThis plugin helps you navigate and develop projects using the [Phoenix web\r\nframework][phoenix]. A Phoenix project is detected by looking for a `mix.exs`\r\nfile along with `web` directory. When you edit a file in a Phoenix project, this\r\nplugin will be activated. This sets various options and defines some commands.\r\nIt also integrates with other Vim plugins.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Integrates with [vim-projectionist][] for navigating project files according\r\n  to Phoenix conventions.\r\n* Comes with extra mappings for [vim-surround][].\r\n* Comes with extra snippets for [UltiSnips][].\r\n* Provides `:Mix` command that delegates to `mix`.\r\n* Provides project-specific Vim navigation settings for `path` and\r\n  `suffixesadd`.\r\n\r\nSee the documentation (`:help phoenix`) for more information.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nUse your favourite Vim plugin manager to install this plugin. I use\r\n[pathogen][]. Otherwise, download this plugin and put the files in its\r\nsubdirectories to the corresponding subdirectories in your `~/.vim` directory.\r\n\r\n## About\r\n\r\nTo find our more about the Phoenix framework, see:\r\nhttps://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix\r\n\r\nTo get the latest updates or report bugs, see this plugin's Github repository:\r\nhttps://github.com/avdgaag/vim-phoenix\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nAuthor: Arjan van der Gaag\r\nURL: http://arjanvandergaag.nl\r\n\r\nThis plugin is based on earlier work by Tim Pope, who has released many\r\nincredible Vim plugins.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nSee LICENSE.\r\n\r\n[vim-projectionist]: https://github.com/tpope/vim-projectionist\r\n[vim-surround]:      https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround\r\n[UltiSnips]:         https://github.com/SirVer/UltiSnips\r\n[vim-pathogen]:      https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen\r\n[phoenix]:           https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix\r\n","google":"UA-20357800-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
